            This portfolio is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The 3D environment is made using Three, a 3D
            Javascript Library which uses WebGL to create animated 3D graphics.

            The aim of the portfolio is to give an example of my knowledge in interaction and design while also having
            somewhere to present my other previous work.

            Highlights of the project:
          </h2>
          <p class="mainText">
            The goal was to create a “one-page” portfolio where I could present myself and put up my previous projects
            for display. Having previously done a few websites in HTML already I decided to make it more interesting by
            integrating Three.js into the project. I did this to challenge myself and to push the limits of my knowledge
            about user interaction and design.
            :
            The 3D environment is in the background while the HTML rests on top. As the user enters the website it is
            presented by the front page which greets them and has a brief introduction about me. The flow is deliberate
            and starts with introductions before the user can freely continue downward for more information, as the user
            scrolls down the site the 3D environment pans out revealing even more of the scene. At the end you can
            clearly see the office in the scene as you browse the main content of the portfolio and how the items in the
            list interact with things on the scene.

            Early in development I switched to my laptop which has a very bad GPU and quickly realized how taxing the 3D
            environment was on low end computers. This caused me to investigate what I could do to optimize the website
            so that lower end computers could stand a chance of rendering the site.

            The answer was dynamic lights and shadows. Having to constantly raytrace and calculate these was very
            demanding so by simply disabling shadows I gained a huge performance boost, but now the environment looks
            worse. I was originally going to implement it so that when a user drops below a certain performance
            threshold the shadows would disable themselves, but instead I found a compromise. I was going to use
            “Shadow-baking”. Shadow baking is when you “snapshot” shadows onto the textures, practically allowing you to
            run without having to constantly calculate the shadow rendering. This solution worked perfectly for this
            project because I mostly have static meshes. Implementing this allowed for my bad laptop to run the site
            flawlessly without compromising the look of the environment.’

            If the 3D environment still made a user lag, or if anyone finds it distracting/confusing i implemented a
            “Simple View” -mode that turns the site into a more basic version.

            In conclusion, Three seems like a really good medium to implement into websites to include 3D functionality.
            You only need to be wary of the taxing performance that could come with it if you don’t plan for it
            properly.
