            About the thesis.
          </h2>
          <p class="text">
            I was asked to help research and develop a tool to assist developers in the process of creating maps, as
            they had identified that it is needlessly time consuming due to certain logistical issues that could be
            alleviated with this program.
            <br><br>
            A Minecraft World or “Map” is an instance of the game where certain aspects have been altered to provide a
            different experience from the regular base game. Everything is up for change, models, behaviors, blocks,
            items and game rules. This makes it so that dedicated studios such as House of How can create playable
            experiences for players to buy access to and enjoy.
            <br><br>
            As outlined in my thesis, there were several pain points for developers to create maps. For example,
            creating an entire new entity to add to the game required several additions to multiple files in multiple
            folders to abide the coding standards set by Microsoft. This caused not only confusion for new developers
            but was also time consuming.
            <br><br>
            I did research, conducted interviews, developed prototypes and had several back and forths with developers
            from the company to pinpoint these issues and find possible countermeasures to include in the tool.
            <br><br>
            As the project progressed the design for the tool became more refined in the form of higher fidelity
            prototypes. The prototyping phase was an iterative process starting off with lower fidelity prototyping and
            wireframing, getting feedback from the company and then continuing the process with the high fidelity
            version made in WPF C# by House of How’s request.

            This portfolio was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The 3D environment is made using <a
              class="introlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://threejs.org/">Three</a>, a 3D
            JavaScript library which uses WebGL to create animated 3D graphics.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of the portfolio is to give an example of my knowledge in interaction design, creating a space
            to
            present some of my projects while also learning about Three and 3D development.

          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">About the project.</h3>
          <p class="text">
            The goal was to create a “one-page” portfolio to present myself and put up my projects for display. Because
            I've already made a few websites in HTML I decided to make it more interesting by integrating Three.js into
            the project. I did this to challenge myself and to push the limits of my knowledge about interaction design.
            <br><br>
            The 3D environment is in the background while the HTML rests on top. As the user scrolls down the site
            revealing more information the 3D environment also pans out revealing even more of the scene.

          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Performance:</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Early in development I switched to my laptop which has a very bad GPU/CPU and quickly realized how taxing
            the 3D environment was on low end computers. This caused me to investigate what I could do to optimize the
            website so that lower end systems could stand a chance of rendering my fairly simple site. I believe this is
            one of the big reasons why we don’t see many websites use dynamic 3D rendering.
            <br><br>
            But I was determined to make it happen. The big culprit was dynamic lighting and shadows. Having to
            constantly raytrace and calculate lighting for even the simplest of models (such as a cube) caused a
            detrimental impact to the performance. By disabling shadows and lighting, the performance went up a lot,
            which isn’t a surprise if you have any experience with video games, where disabling shadows is a common
            solution to increase performance.
            <br><br>
            However, that left me with a rather unattractive background for a site and required me to go back to the
            drawing board and learn even more about 3D rendering, things I did not expect I would have to learn in order
            to get this to work.
            <br><br>
            The solution I found was a common technique used in the 3D space called “shadow baking”. Baking a shadow
            means that you save the textures with the lighting (or shadows) that is projected onto that texture,
            essentially taking a screenshot of all the models in that scene. This means that we do not need dynamic
            lighting in our scene anymore, getting that performance boost I previously mentioned while still emulating
            lights and shadows.
            <br><br>
            Now this was anything but simple, as I’m new to Blender and Three, but after a few tries I learned the
            tricks and made it work. Shadow baking is an essential technique for working with 3D regardless if you use
            dynamic lighting or not. There’s a bunch of other techniques like ambient occlusion and light -mapping to
            ease the burden on our systems while rendering 3D environments. This project only used shadow baking. The
            drawback of not having dynamic lights is that we can’t have things move that would need shadows as they are
            stuck on the textures, but in the case of non moving models this is an amazing option.
            <br><br>
            Another issue I encountered was that I first made a very detailed high fidelity scene in Blender without
            thinking about the model size after export. Complex high fidelity models don't really lag using baked
            shadows, however they do increase in size quite a bit, namely because of the textures. The first scene I
            made was 300MB large (probably bloated from a lot of accumulated textures and materials) which is..
            unsustainable for a website to say the least. This caused me to go back and learn a few things to bake lower
            resolution textures while still retaining most of the quality. And it worked out great, the current project
            has a size of about 9mb which I then further compressed using this compression <a class="introlink"

            In this course we learned more about developing prototypes for mobile applications. The last project of the
            course was very open ended, the main goal and purpose was to end up with a high fidelity prototype. How you
            made it and with what, was up to us to decide.

            We developed an idea called “Prototypiska party-pinglor” which was an application that would gather a list
            of the closest party places (bars) and give a condensed neat summary to the user.
            <br><br>
            First we started off developing the application in a program called Figma (a simple online prototyping
            tool). After deciding on a design we then began further developing the application using React native.

            To pull “party places" we used Google's API. This allowed us to get some information on bars within a

          <p class="text">
            During the course we made three individual projects, each integrating something new into to our use of
            Android Studio. The first project was a "space-shooter", a sort of Flappy Bird clone with shooting, see
            below in Figure 1.

            By holding down to accelerate you also fly upwards. Due to it being a mobile game it had touch controls to
            the left for acceleration and a button to the right for firing. The first project was more about learning
            the ways of Android Studio and how it works.

            The second project was to develop a platformerm, each project had a list of features that you could choose
            from to implement. You had to choose a certain number of them to pass the course.
            The platformer i made had spikes you took damage from if you touched them, life points, score system and
            sound effects.

          <h3 class="sub-title">Conclusion.</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Working with Android Studio and with native mobile applications in general, the environment and work
            structure is quite different from what i was used to. Having to deal with window instances and different
            ways to map input and controls was not something i was used to at this point. However, Android Studio
            provides a fairly good interface for developing application even though it felt clumsy at times (especially
            compared to Unity).

            The focus of this course was to apply our business and engineering knowledge to develop an idea into a
            technical system. The workflow covers the entire business development chain from idea to presentation of a
            prototype and business plan using Business Model Canvas (BMC). The course also covered entrepreneurship and

          </h2>
          <p class="text">
            The idea we (a group of 3) came up with was called “Workshift”, a service that was to quickly and smoothly
            match a person’s competencies with the skills and needs of the employers.
            <br><br>
            The matching would take place in an application where people create profiles containing their skills and
            previous experiences and where employers would go to find people perfect for their specific job. The main
            purpose behind the idea was to ease the burden on people without jobs and to let them have a broad reach in
            multiple areas of their field without having to actively look for them and for companies to have an easy
            service to find the right person for the position. Think Tinder but for jobs.
            <br><br>
            One of the main selling points was that it was going to bundle everything that goes into recruiting in one,
            even signing contracts.
            <br><br>
            As the purpose of the course was to practice assessing ideas over several iterations and evaluate the
            business viability based on the BMC, the conclusion of the project was that it was too similar to very large
            competitors (LinkedIn) and unless re-evaluated and niched to separate ourselves from them it would be hard
            to realistically implement.
            <br><br>
            The prototype was made using a website called <a class="introlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://www.framer.com/">Framer</a>. Framer allows for simultaneous editing on prototypes.
            One of its main features is that it supports a component based work structure similar to React. Framer also
            lets you export components you’ve made into React for further implementation (not something we used for this
            project).

        better understanding of what's possible when trying to bridge the two worlds.
        <br>
        <br>
        From my studies I've taken the first steps out into the world of code, learning C, Java, HTML (CSS), Javascript
        and <a class="introlink" href="#">more.</a> I've also had a lot of experience with design and UX.
        <br>
        <br>
        I want to get involved in software development, to learn and to grow as a developer. Thank you.
