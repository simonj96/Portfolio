This portfolio is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The 3D environment is made using Three, a 3D Javascript Library which uses WebGL to create animated 3D graphics.

The aim of the portfolio is to give an example of my knowledge in interaction and design while also having somewhere to present my other previous work.
