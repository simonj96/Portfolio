            About the thesis.
          </h2>
          <p class="text">
            I was asked to help research and develop a tool to assist developers in the process of creating maps, as
            they had identified that it is needlessly time consuming due to certain logistical issues that could be
            alleviated with this program.
            <br><br>
            A Minecraft World or “Map” is an instance of the game where certain aspects have been altered to provide a
            different experience from the regular base game. Everything is up for change, models, behaviors, blocks,
            items and game rules. This makes it so that dedicated studios such as House of How can create playable
            experiences for players to buy access to and enjoy.
            <br><br>
            As outlined in my thesis, there were several pain points for developers to create maps. For example,
            creating an entire new entity to add to the game required several additions to multiple files in multiple
            folders to abide the coding standards set by Microsoft. This caused not only confusion for new developers
            but was also time consuming.
            <br><br>
            I did research, conducted interviews, developed prototypes and had several back and forths with developers
            from the company to pinpoint these issues and find possible countermeasures to include in the tool.
            <br><br>
            As the project progressed the design for the tool became more refined in the form of higher fidelity
            prototypes. The prototyping phase was an iterative process starting off with lower fidelity prototyping and
            wireframing, getting feedback from the company and then continuing the process with the high fidelity
            version made in WPF C# by House of How’s request.

            This portfolio was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The 3D environment is made using <a
              class="introlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://threejs.org/">Three</a>, a 3D
            JavaScript library which uses WebGL to create animated 3D graphics.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of the portfolio is to give an example of my knowledge in interaction design, creating a space
            to
            present some of my projects while also learning about Three and 3D development.

          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">About the project.</h3>
          <p class="text">
            The goal was to create a “one-page” portfolio to present myself and put up my projects for display. Because
            I've already made a few websites in HTML I decided to make it more interesting by integrating Three.js into
            the project. I did this to challenge myself and to push the limits of my knowledge about interaction design.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p class="text">
            The 3D environment is in the background while the HTML rests on top. As the user scrolls down the site
            revealing more information the 3D environment also pans out revealing even more of the scene.

          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Performance:</h3>
          <p class="text">
            Early in development I switched to my laptop which has a very bad GPU/CPU and quickly realized how taxing
            the 3D environment was on low end computers. This caused me to investigate what I could do to optimize the
            website so that lower end systems could stand a chance of rendering my fairly simple site. I believe this is
            one of the big reasons why we don’t see many websites use dynamic 3D rendering.
            <br><br>
            But I was determined to make it happen. The big culprit was dynamic lighting and shadows. Having to
            constantly raytrace and calculate lighting for even the simplest of models (such as a cube) caused a
            detrimental impact to the performance. By disabling shadows and lighting, the performance went up a lot,
            which isn’t a surprise if you have any experience with video games, where disabling shadows is a common
            solution to increase performance.
            <br><br>
            However, that left me with a rather unattractive background for a site and required me to go back to the
            drawing board and learn even more about 3D rendering, things I did not expect I would have to learn in order
            to get this to work.
            <br><br>
            The solution I found was a common technique used in the 3D space called “shadow baking”. Baking a shadow
            means that you save the textures with the lighting (or shadows) that is projected onto that texture,
            essentially taking a screenshot of all the models in that scene. This means that we do not need dynamic
            lighting in our scene anymore, getting that performance boost I previously mentioned while still emulating
            lights and shadows.
            <br><br>
            Now this was anything but simple, as I’m new to Blender and Three, but after a few tries I learned the
            tricks and made it work. Shadow baking is an essential technique for working with 3D regardless if you use
            dynamic lighting or not. There’s a bunch of other techniques like ambient occlusion and light -mapping to
            ease the burden on our systems while rendering 3D environments. This project only used shadow baking. The
            drawback of not having dynamic lights is that we can’t have things move that would need shadows as they are
            stuck on the textures, but in the case of non moving models this is an amazing option.

          </div>
          <p class="text">
            Another issue I encountered was that I first made a very detailed high fidelity scene in Blender without
            thinking about the model size after export. Complex high fidelity models don't really lag using baked
            shadows, however they do increase in size quite a bit, namely because of the textures. The first scene I
            made was 300MB large (probably bloated from a lot of accumulated textures and materials) which is..
            unsustainable for a website to say the least. This caused me to go back and learn a few things to bake lower
            resolution textures while still retaining most of the quality. And it worked out great, the current project
            has a size of about 9mb which I then further compressed using this compression <a class="introlink"

          <p class="text">
            In the course "Prototype development for mobile applications" we learned more about the process of
            prototyping. The last project of the
            course was very open ended, the purpose was to practice at cooperating on design and to recieve
            and give feedback in cycles. Hopefully, in the end you would end up with a nice prototype for an idea you
            had
            as a
            group.
            <br><br>
            Since there's a wide range of tools to use for creating prototypes, which one we used was up to us. We
            decided on first using <a class="introlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> (a simple online prototyping tool) during the earlier stages of
            the project, then finalizing the prototype in React Native.

            Our idea was called "Night Out", which was supposed to be an application for searching for places to go out
            to. Since we wanted some functionality, we made use of Google's API to fetch bars within a certain radius,
            and made use of Googles information.

          <p class="text">
            In Figure 2, you can see how it looked while browsing through the different bars. Because our information
            from Google was rather limited we decided on leveraging the information that we had, the best way we could.
            At a glace you knew the pricing, if it's open or closed and how far away it was. If you clicked on "more"
            you got more information shown in Figure 3 below.

            This is a project from “Innovative mobile services and systems” where the focus was about the concept <a

              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">"Internet of Things"</a>, similarly to the
            previous project a lot of the focus was on developing an idea, a design and lastly a prototype. This time
            however, there was a caveat that we had to use different sensors that a company had provided for us. These
            sensors were hooked up to the internet and could be used for a variety of things. Temperature, movement, you
            name it. They all had an API we could work towards and that's how we created SmartTable.

            The idea was to use sensors that could detect if anyone was present to create an application that could tell
            you what tables are occupied at the Univeristy. After some interviews we created a prototype in React Native
            that uses MazeMap to display the campus and tables. However the reliability of the sensors coupled with the
            fact that we didn't actually get to place any sensors (because they were expensive), made it so that this
            was as far as the prototype went, see Figure 4 for a collection of images of the prototype.
